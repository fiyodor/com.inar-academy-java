    1.42 What are syntax errors (compile errors), runtime errors, and logic errors?
         Syntax errors are detected by compilers.
         Runtime errors occur during execution of the program.
         Logic errors results in incorrect results.

    1.43 Give examples of syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors.
         Listings 04, 05 and 06

    1.44 If you forget to put a closing quotation mark on a string, what kind error will be raised?
         Syntax error.
    1.45 If your program needs to read integers, but the user entered strings, an error would occur when running this program. What kind of error is this?
         Runtime error.

    1.46 Suppose you write a program for computing the perimeter of a rectangle and you mistakenly write your program so that it computes the area of a rectangle.
    What kind of error is this?
         Logic error.

    1.47 Identify and fix the errors in the following code:
         public class Welcome {
            public void Main(String[] args) {               //static main
                System.out.println('Welcome to Java!);      //"....."
            }
        }
     */
}
