    1.10 What language does the CPU understand?
        The machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer. This is the language understood by a computer and executed by a computer.

    1.11 What is an assembly language?
        Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each of the machine language instructions.

    1.12 What is an assembler?
        Assembler is a software that translates assembly language into machine language.

    1.13 What is a high-level programming language?
        The high-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program.

    1.14 What is a source program?
        The program written in a programming language is called a source program.

    1.15 What is an interpreter?
        An interpreter is a software that reads one statement from the source code, translates it to the machine code or virtual machine code, and then executes it right away.

    1.16 What is a compiler?
        A compiler is a software that translates a program in high-level language into machine language code.

    1.17 What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?
        An interpreter reads one statement from the source code, and translates it to the machine code or virtual machine code,
        and then executes it right away. A compiler translates the entire source code into a machine code file, and the machine code file is then executed.
