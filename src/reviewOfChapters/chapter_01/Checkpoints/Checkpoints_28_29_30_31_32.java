    1.28 What is a keyword? List some Java keywords.
         Keywords have specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program such as variables or method names.
         Examples of keywords are class, static, and void.

    1.29 Is Java case-sensitive? What is the case for Java keywords?
         Java source code is case-sensitive.
         Java keywords are always in lowercase.

   1.30 What is a comment? Is the comment ignored by the compiler? How do you denote a comment line and a comment paragraph?
         //Comments are used to document what a program is for and how a program is constructed. Comments help the programmers or users to communicate and understand the program.
         //Comments are not programming statements and are ignored by the compiler.
        // In Java, comments are preceded by two forward slashes (//) in a line or enclosed /* and */ // in multiple lines.>> // When the compiler sees //, it ignores all text after // in the same line.
        // When it sees /*, it scans for the next */ and ignores any text between /* and */.

                System.out.println(3.5 * 4 / 2 – 2.5);
            }
         }
         3.5 * 4 / 2 - 2.5 is
         4.5
