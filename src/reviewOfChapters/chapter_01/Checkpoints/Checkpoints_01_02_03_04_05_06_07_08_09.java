    1.1 What are hardware and software?
        A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data. A computer includes both hardware and software.
        In general, hardware is the physical aspect of the computer that can be seen, and software is the invisible instructions that control
        the hardware and make it work.The hardware of a computer consists of a CPU, cache, memory, hard disk, floppy disk, monitor, printer,
        and communication devices.

    1.2 List five major hardware components of a computer.
        Five major hardware components: CPU, Memory, Storage Devices, Input/Out Devices, and Communication Devices.

    1.3 What does the acronym “CPU” stand for?
        CPU stands for Central Processing Unit.

    1.4 What unit is used to measure CPU speed?
        It is the brain of the computer. The unit of measurement of clock speed is the hertz (Hz), with 1 hertz equaling 1 pulse per second.
        The clock speed of a computer is usually stated in megahertz (MHz) (1 MHz is 1 million Hz).

    1.5 What is a bit? What is a byte?
        A bit is a binary digit 0 or 1. A byte is a sequence of 8 bits.

    1.6 What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?
        Memory is like a work area for programs. Before a program is executed, it is brought into the memory.
        RAM stands for random-access memory.
        It is called RAM because a memory cell can be accessed directly.

    1.7 What unit is used to measure memory size?
        Memory size is measured in bytes.

    1.8 What unit is used to measure disk size?
        Disk size is measured in bytes.

    1.9 What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
        Memory is volatile, because information is lost when the power is turned off.
        Programs and data are permanently stored on storage devices and are moved, when the computer actually uses them, to memory,
        which is much faster than storage devices.
