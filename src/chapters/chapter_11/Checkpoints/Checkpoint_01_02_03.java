    // A subclass is not a subset of a superclass

    // in subclasses we use the keyword 'extends' (Ex Rectangle extends GeometricObject)

    // a class can have only one superclass. this is single inheritance. in some other languages multiple inheritance allowed. in multiple inheritance a class may have multiple superclasses.
    // Java doesnt allow multiple inheritance
